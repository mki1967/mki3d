MKI 3D RAPID MODELER
by mki1967@gmail.com

MKI 3D RAPID MODELER is a keyboard-driven Chrome application 
for creating simple 3D models consisting of colored line segments and triangles.

The program evolves towards the functionality of 
https://github.com/mki1967/et-edit
However, the underlying data structures, file formats,
and user interface are being redesigned:
- Data structure is less 'parsimonious'. In particular, each element (line segment or triangle) has its own endpoints.
- File format is JSON of the data configuration that can be easily stored and manipulated by other applications.
- The general rule of the user interface is that the possible key-press actions
  are displayed to the user by the means of hierarchical menus. 
  There is only small set of key-press actions that has to be initially memorized by the user
  (moving the cursor, rotating the screen and so on ...)


To read the instructions and general description of the program,
press the 'H' key.
