    <h1>How to Use Input and Output through Textareas in MKI3D RAPID MODELLER</h1>
    <p>
      If the file chooser is not available then you can load and save data through text areas.
      Fortunately, the data are in textual form.
    </p>

    <h3>Saving:</h3>
    <p>
      Textarea contains the data to be saved.
      You have the following two options for saving:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use DOWNLOAD LINK</dt>
      <dd>
	This is the same procedure as for downloading of the file.
	Note that you can set in the browser to ask you where to save the downloaded file.
      </dd>
      <dt>Copy-paste from textarea to text editor and save it to the file</dt>
      <dd>
	This is not recomended. Note that some outputs contain very long lines and not all
	editors can efficiently cope with such data.
      </dd>
    </dl>     

    <h3>Loading:</h3>
    <p>
      You are presented with empty editable textarea. You have to fill this textarea with input data and press ENTER.
      For example, you can open a new tab in your browser.In this tab, open the URL:
      <code>file:///path_to_your_file_with_data</code>. The text of the file should be displayed in the tab.
      Select and copy all the text, then switch back to the tab with MKI3D, paste the text to the textarea and press Enter.
      In most browsers you should be able to use Ctrl-A for selection, Ctrl-C to copy, and Ctrl-V to paste.
      Note that you can keep opened the URL:  <code>file:///path_to_your_directory_with_data_files</code> in separate browser's tab and
      use it as a 'file chooser' for loading.
