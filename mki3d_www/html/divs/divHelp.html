	    You can cover triangles with textures defined with <a href="https://mki1967.github.io/texturion/" target="_blank">TEXTURION</a>.
	    The textured stages can be viewed with
	    <a href="https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d/mki3d_www/travel.html?input=https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d-data/data/web/stage1-textured3a.mki3d" target="_blank">
	      MKI3D TRAVEL</a>.
	    Other programs using MKI3D data are to be updated to display the  textured objects.
	    Exporting and stereoscopic view of textured elements are not implemented, yet.

	  <li>
	    You can press 'D' key to have a display without the cursor and the upper text message. Then you can save the clean image from the canvas
	    (e.g. take a screen-shot or - if you run it in the browser - save graphics on the  right-mouse-button pop-up menu).
	    Pressing any key resumes standard display mode for further editing.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Red-blue stereoscopic mode has been added. Press 'QVS' key sequence to toggle the stereo/mono-scopic mode.

      <h3> General description </h3>
      <p>
	The <em>model</em> consists of line <em>segments</em> and <em>triangles</em>.
        Each <em>segment</em> is defined by a pair of <em>points</em> (<em> endpoints</em> of the segment). 
        Each <em>triangle</em> is defined by a triple of <em>points</em> (<em> endpoints</em> of the triangle). 
        Each <em>point</em> has position in (x,y,z) coordinates and a color (R,G,B) components.
        Each <em>point</em> belongs to a single <em>set</em>.
        The <em>sets</em> are indexed by natural numbers.
	The set index numbers are assigned automatically to the endpoints,
	and the program tries to keep the indexes of non-empty sets to be consecutive numbers
	starting from zero.
        Element is <em>in</em> a set if all its endpoints are in the set.
	Element is <em>incident to</em> a set if at least one of its endpoints is in the set.
        Element is <em>glue element</em> if its endpoints are in different sets.
	Glue element is incident to more than one set and it is not in any set.
      </p>
      <p>
	Endpoints can be <em>selected</em>.
	Element is <em>selected</em> if all its endpoints are selected.
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>Constructive points</em> denoted by the letters 'A'...'Z' are used to denote positions in the 
	space. They are used as parameters of <em>constructive methods</em>.
	They can be set and then displayed or hidden. 
	(If two or more constructive points are displayed at the same position, then it is signaled by flashing between two
        of them in subsequent redraws.)  
      </p>

      <h3> Some Usage Hints </h3>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Press the Shift key to move the cursor with the Arrows ,'B' 'V' (i.e. back), and 'F' (i.e. forward) keys.
	  (Instead of Arrow keys you may also use the 'I','J','K','L' keys.)
	</li>
	<li>
          Release the Shift key to rotate the model around the cursor with the arrows and 'B', 'F'.
          (Focus point - the center of the screen - is set to the cursor position.)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Use Space to align rotation rotation to right angles.
	</li>
        <li>
          To insert segment lines:
	  <ol>
	    <li> move the cursor to the position of its first endpoint and press Enter to set MARKER1, </li>
	    <li> move the cursor to the position of its second endpoint and press Enter to insert the segment 
	      and to set MARKER1 at the new position, </li>
            <li> and so on - continue with the following segments' endpoints.</li>
	  </ol>
          To stop inserting lines, press Escape key to cancel markers.
        </li>
        <li> 
          To insert a triangle:
	  <ol>
	    <li> move the cursor to the first endpoint and press Enter to set MARKER1, </li>
	    <li> move the cursor to the second endpoint and press 'T' to set MARKER2, </li>
            <li> move the cursor to the third endpoint and press Enter to insert the triangle. 
              (This also sets MARKER1, so you can continue inserting segments or triangles.)
	    </li>
	  </ol>

	</li>
	<li> 
          The light consists of directional fraction and small ambient fraction. 
	  To set directional light for triangles' shading, rotate the model and press 'QDL' sequence of keys.
          Directional light is set perpendicular to the screen (in both directions).
	</li>
	<li>
	  The color of inserted endpoint is the color of the cursor.
          The selected endpoints can be painted with current cursor color.
          If endpoints of the element have different colors, 
	  the colors inside the element are interpolated.
	</li>
	<li>
          You can limit visibility by clipping - the key sequences 'QX...'
	</li>
	<li>
	  You can select endpoints - the key sequences 'QS ...'
          (Note that you can either add new endpoints to selection or remove all selection.) 
	</li>
	<li>
	  You may use selection to limit visibility (in 'QV' sub-menu) or 
	  manipulate selected endpoints (in 'QD' sub-menu)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Sets can be used for grouping endpoints.
	  Use 'N' in canvas mode to cycle through the sets inspecting their included and incident elements.
          (The last set in the cycle is always empty - stop at it if you want the following endpoints to be 
          in a new set.)
	  You also create a new set when you are making a copy of selected elements ('QDC...').
          After creation of a copy, the selection is switched to this new copy.
          Thus the actions on selected endpoints are applied on the new copy.
	</li>
	<li>
	  To cancel view restrictions use 'QVC' sequence.
	</li>
	<li>
	  You can change the color of the cursor ('QCC') or of the background ('QDB').
	  Cursor color is used for the created endpoints (unless they are copies of other endpoints) and
	  for painting. 
          You can set one of the seven predefined colors. 
	  You can also fine-tune each of the RGB components separately with the pairs of keys: 'E'-'R', 'F'-'G', and 'V'-'B'.
          To use already used color, select the endpoints and, in the Color Menu, use 'N' to cycle trough the colors of the
          selected endpoints.
          Leave the color menu by pressing either 'Q' or Escape key.
	</li>
	<li>
	  DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR DATA (key sequence: 'QFS')
	</li>
	<li>
	  You may export your model to HTML WebGL page ('QFE'). You need to download the script
	  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mki1967/mki3d/master/html_viewer/mki3d_view.js" target="_blank">mki3d_view.js</a> 
	  and save it to each folder with the exported HTML pages. 
	  This script is used by the exported HTML pages.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Use 'QPS...' to set constructive points. You can hide them with 'QPH'. 
	  You can find any previously set constructive point (hidden or displayed) with 'QPJ...'.
	</li>
	<li>
	  You can manually set the cursor coordinates and some other parameters
	  on the Inputs Page ('QI...').
	</li>
      </ul>
